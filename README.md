Definition
High Cohesion: A design principle where a class or module is highly focused on a single task or responsibility. All methods and attributes within the class are related to this responsibility, making the class easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

Low Cohesion: When a class or module has multiple, unrelated responsibilities, resulting in a lack of focus. This makes the class more complex, harder to understand, and difficult to maintain.

Usage
High Cohesion: Use this principle to design classes that focus on a single responsibility. For example, a class managing a pen should only handle actions related to writing or providing information about the pen, ensuring it is easy to use and maintain.

Low Cohesion: Avoid combining unrelated tasks within a single class. For example, a class that manages a pen should not handle unrelated responsibilities like sending emails, as this complicates the class and violates the single responsibility principle.
